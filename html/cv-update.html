                      Your resume should be no longer than 1-2 pages. Keep it to 1 page if you have
                      less than 8 years of professional work experience. If you have more, you might
                      consider using 2 pages.

                    <li>
                      Include a skills section - it's incredibly important. This step will prove
                      highly valuable if the company uses ATS (applicant tracking system).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Unless otherwise specified by the company or the job description, submit your
                      resume in pdf format. You can convert this file to pdf in google docs by going
                      to File, select Download, and then pdf.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Write 2-5 bullet points for each position, depending on the duration and
                      relevance of the position. Keep sections that are less relevant to the job
                      you're applying to short.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Your most recent position should have the most bullet points, as long as the
                      position is relevant to the one you're applying for.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Describe your existing role using the present continuous tense and describe
                      past roles using the past simple tense.

                      It's not enough to describe what you have done or your areas of
                      responsibility, you need to quantify the impact of your work. Recruiters scan
                      resumes for numbers, so quantify as much as you can.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can talk about ××% improvement your initiatives yielded.</li>
                    <li>
                      Or vou could mention the increase in company revenue of ××% that vour work
                      contributed to.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than 2 lines. No recruiter will
                      read bullet points that are as long as paragraphs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Carefully review vour resume several times to eliminate any typos.
                      Additionall, consider having someone else proofread it to prevent sending an
                      imperfect resume.

                      Be consistent with grammar. Generally, resumes should be written in the past
                      tense. The exception is if vou're describing your current position with
                      ongoing responsibilities.

                      section to the top of the page.

                    <li>
                      If you have 5-8 years of work experience, do not include internship experience
                      in your resume unless highly relevant.
